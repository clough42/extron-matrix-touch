                    The buttons on the left side of the main screen select the content that will be displayed
                on the projectors and screens throughout the building.  Each preset has a pre-programmed
                set of inputs that will be shown on each screen.  Touch a preset name to activate the preset.
                The screens will immediately switch to show the selected content.

                    The buttons on the right side of the main screen select which source will be shown on the
                preview monitor.  The preview monitor is useful for viewing content before it is displayed
                on the main screens.  Use this to monitor a video source like a camera or to cue up a DVD
                before switching it to the main screens.

                <Paragraph>
                    Sometimes it is necessary to send a video source to one or more screens independent of
                    the presets.  This may be used to show a DVD on a screen in the lobby while using the
                    other screens for other purposes.

                    To set up an override, touch the "Overrides" icon at the top of the screen.  The overrides
                    page will open.  For each screen, select the video source you would like to display on that
                    screen.  Any screens set to "(none)" will continue to show the content selected by the current
                    preset.  Any screens set with overrides will display the override content, regardless of the
                    operation of the rest of the system.  Click "Save" to activate the selected overrides.

                    When overrides are active, the overrides icon will turn red as a reminder.  To clear overrides,

                    The settings menu contains various screens for setting up the matrix switch controller, naming
